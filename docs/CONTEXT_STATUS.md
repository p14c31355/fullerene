# Context-efficient project status

Read this file first when investigating the current hardware goal. It is a
compact index of the evidence; the linked hardware ledgers retain the full
commands, timestamps, hashes, and per-run notes.

## Current goal

| Goal | Success criterion | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pixel 4a 5G (Bramble) USB handoff | Fullerene enumerates as `idVendor=1234` | Not reached |
| Recovery safety | Failed handoff returns to Android without flashing or erasing | Confirmed with `fastboot boot` runs |

## What is actually known

| Boundary | Evidence | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fastboot handoff | The device leaves Fastboot and Fullerene reaches USB High-Speed attach | Pull-up/attach works; this is not enumeration success |
| First control request | Host submits `GET_DESCRIPTOR(Device)` | The host sees a Fullerene USB device address path |
| Response | usbmon records no returned bytes (`len=0`, `cap=0`) | No descriptor payload exists to wrap or re-encode |
| Failure | A valid capture shows `-2`, followed by zero-length `-71` retries | The error is before a usable EP0 response; Linux `-EPROTO` is a broad host error class |
| Software latches | Current setup/event/SOF diagnostic latches have not produced a usable readout | DWC3 event production/consumption and USB2 RX/UTMI remain unresolved |
| Recovery | Android returns as `18d1:4ee7` | The experiment is non-destructive, but Fullerene still does not enumerate |

## Current fixed baseline

Keep these values fixed while isolating one new boundary at a time:

| Area | Baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Clock | Lito mock-UTMI source at 60 MHz; the 19.2 MHz value is the QUSB2 PHY reference-clock path |
| UTMI | 8-bit `PHYIF`; `USBTRDTIM=9` |
| Event ring | 4096-byte Android-sized control event buffer |
| EP0 | Linux/Android-style setup TRB and `STARTTRANSFER` with `DEPCMD_PARAM=0` |
| Handoff | Direct USB2 reuse path, no SMMU, attach-reaching `STARTTRANSFER`, Android resource order |
| Safety | `fastboot boot` only; no flash, erase, or persistent modification |

## Most useful negative results

These rows summarize families of experiments; use the full ledger for every
run ID and artifact hash.

| Family | Result | What it rules out for now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clock source/rate and settle delay | 60 MHz correction, branch rearm, and 20 ms settle did not produce data | Clock enable/settling alone is not sufficient |
| UTMI width/timing | 16-bit variants and matched/mismatched `USBTRDTIM` still failed before payload | Descriptor formatting is not the first failure; PHY contract is still a hypothesis, not proof |
| HS-PHY reset/rails/tuning | Android reset timing, rail refresh, ref-clock vote, and termination tune did not move the boundary | The tested power/reset ordering alone is not sufficient |
| DWC3 policy | `SUSPHY`, `ENBLSLPM`, retry policy, LPM policy, and core-clock variants did not produce data | These individual policy bits are not the immediate fix |
| DMA/event publication | XBL addresses, Fastboot event DMA reuse, 4096-byte ring, and Run/Stop republish did not expose a response | No single tested ring-address/publication variant is sufficient |
| EP0 ordering | Connect Done, USB Reset, eager/ungated arm, stall flush, and Android restart variants did not reach `1234` | The remaining issue is still at or below EP0 ownership/event/link handling |
| Protocol classifier | APSS-WDT recovery landed in the common `boot-reason=watchdog` bucket | No xHCI completion subcode or DWC3 protocol code was obtained |
| ABL command-parameter mask | ABL-style selective `DEPCMDPAR` publication still ended at host `-110` and Android recovery | This A/B is negative for enumeration; the later exact EP-config run supplies the parallel `-2`→`-71`/zero-payload classification |
| ABL/Qualcomm EP config | Exact disassembly/msm `SETEPCONFIG` fields plus the ABL command-parameter mask still produced no payload and no `1234` | The EP0 `P0/P1` mismatch is now ruled out as the immediate fix; the `-71` path remains a pre-payload ownership/transport boundary |
| ABL request/TRB flags | ABL's `0x405` request control base (`HWO|CHN|ISP_IMI`) also produced `-2`→`-71` with `len=0`/`cap=0` | The `LST|IOC` versus ABL flag difference alone is not sufficient; resolve request-object/ring ownership before another flag permutation |

## Next source-directed investigation

| Order | Check | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Compare ABL's request-object/ring ownership state around `0x29b14` with local EP0 slots and event consumption | The single-TRB ABL flags A/B was negative; the remaining source-derived delta is the request slot, ring cursor/link, and event acknowledgement sequence |
| 2 | Repeat the ABL command-mask A/B with bus-1 usbmon in parallel if the exact host completion class is needed | The previous run only provides the kernel-visible `-110` result |
| 3 | Obtain a real DWC3 event/count or privileged xHCI completion-code readout | It separates controller/event ownership from USB2/UTMI framing |
| 4 | Only after a valid EP0 data stage, inspect descriptor bytes and any packet-level transformation | Wrapping is downstream of the observed zero-payload boundary |

Latest classified hardware run: `2092314.0` submitted four Device Descriptor requests; all completions had `len=0`, `cap=0` (`-2` once, then `-71` three times). This A/B used the source-confirmed ABL EP0 request TRB control base `0x405` and still produced no payload, so the current Protocol Error investigation belongs at EP0 request/ring ownership or below, not in descriptor wrapping.

## Document routing and context cost

| Document | Size | Use | Loading policy |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| [`HARDWARE_aarch64.md`](HARDWARE_aarch64.md) | 514 lines / 236 KB | Full Bramble ledger and source audit | Read targeted sections or this index first |
| [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md) | 523 lines / 117 KB | Cross-platform hardware notes plus Bramble summary | Read the Bramble section and this index; avoid loading the full table |
| [`BUG_JOURNAL.md`](BUG_JOURNAL.md) | 1,410 lines / 66 KB | Historical software investigations, mostly Wi-Fi and runtime | Not needed for the Bramble USB path unless a related regression appears |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | 1,037 lines / 38 KB | Project-wide design rules | Read only when changing architecture or ownership boundaries |
| [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) | 679 lines / 29 KB | Build and run procedures | Read the Bramble command section when running hardware |
| `docs/history/*.png` | 3.1 MB | Historical screenshots/artifacts | Do not load for USB source debugging |

The two hardware ledgers account for about 353 KB of text and contain the
only unusually long lines: 386 rows in `HARDWARE_aarch64.md` exceed 200
characters, and the longest row is about 1,278 characters. The individual
experiment rows are valuable evidence, but loading the whole ledger into an
agent context repeats the same negative conclusion many times. This index is
the compact working memory; the ledgers remain the evidence archive.
